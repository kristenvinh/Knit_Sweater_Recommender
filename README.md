# Knit_Sweater_Recommender

This project was created by Kristen Vinh in 2025 as part of her Rochester Institute of Technology MS in Data Science capstone course to develop an algorithm that could recommend knitting sweater patterns from a user-uploaded photo.

To run: download project files and install project requirements, then run the main.py app. Then open the index.html file in your browser and test it out using your own photo or a photo from the example_photos folder.
